                    Rafting consists of the descent of rivers in inflatable boats, where the members of the boat

                    paddle under the command of an instructor, responsible for guiding the group during the course.

                    Its practice implies very important concepts in the relationship between people, such as solidarity,

                    unity, leadership, teamwork and sensory perception.

                    Rafting derived from canoeing, it was discovered in 1869 when John Wesley Power, organized

                    the first expedition on the Colorado River, USA, in rowboats. The difficulty of navigating a whitewater

                    river (rapids) in wooden boats was what differentiated Rafting from canoeing, as the vessel evolved

                    into rubber boats that did not break on the rocks, finally in 1909, the first commercial Rafting trip was

                    made. In 1908, the self-bailer boat appeared (which contains a system for the water to exit through

                    the bottom of the boat while maintaining the buoyancy) which, combined with new materials, gave

                    impetus to the sport.
