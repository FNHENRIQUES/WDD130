<p>Hi guys, I’m very excited to learn more about html and CSS doing projects with you and studying in this class. I’m from São Paulo, Brazil.</p>
<p>I’m going to get a bachelor’s degree in software development. </p>
<p>I like play guitar, I’m married, I have 6 children, I work at Banco do Brasil, as a Business Assistant and I hope to get a position in technology department before I get my certificate. </p>
<p>The more important thing to me in BYU – Idaho is that no matter what we study, we follow the learning model we are prepared in the way of discipleship. </p>
<p>I guess more than never, websites and navigator, are the way everybody communicate with computer devices and knowing how create and programming web pages is the way to be prepared to do all type of applications. </p>
<p>I´m member of the Church since 1992 and I served a mission in Fortaleza- Brazil. My favorite quote "Never let a problem to be solved become more important than a person to be loved. "President Thomas S. Monson and my favorite Scripture is Alma 37:37 “Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day.” </p>
<p>I hope to learn grown spiritually learn how to serve people using html and CSS in this class.
Best regards. </p>
